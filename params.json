  "body": "# X32-Behringer\r\n---\r\nI made the acquisition of a Behringer X32 standard console for my music studio and gig needs.\r\n\r\nGreat unit! is all I can say. No or very minor problems with it, a pretty good sound (to me anyways), easy to manage and learn, embedding great effects and a lot of capabilities, including being controllable through OSC protocol.\r\n\r\n## OSC (Open Sound Control)\r\nI decided to spend a little time (well... initially :-)) understanding the OSC programming aspects to interface with the X32, and have it do things for me. This work resulted in an updated, [unofficial X32 OSC protocol](https://sites.google.com/site/patrickmaillot/docs/X32-OSC.pdf) document which I hope will help many others.\r\n\r\n## X32 Utilities\r\nOver time, I developed utilities for my own use and help other users. These utilities running under different operating systems. Some Raspberry and Mac/OSX versions are available, although testing has been minimal with Mac. \r\n\r\nMy [website](https://sites.google.com/site/patrickmaillot/x32) includes several utilities you can just click on to download the latest Windows, Mac or Linux executable versions of. This [Git repository](https://github.com/pmaillot/X32-Behringer) holds many of the utilities' source code, and you are welcome to download/clone, modify and bring enhancements to the proposed programs.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nAll programs, utilities and source code Â©Patrick-Gilles Maillot\r\nCommercial users should contact me for authorization prior commercial use of any program or utility.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Patrick-Gilles Maillot\r\n\r\n\r\n",
