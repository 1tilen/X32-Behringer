# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary:
This is a repository for X32 OSC program files. I will try to push/commit most of the utilities I have been writing since 2013 for the X32 Standard console I bought then.
The first one I committed is X32_Command, a simple yet very useful and powerful command line tool for interacting with the X32 digital console.
 
### Demos and documentation ###

### How do I get set up? ###

The tools are generally simple C programs, some are just command line tools, others (to come) are Windows application using MSC windows, or GTK for some of them.
